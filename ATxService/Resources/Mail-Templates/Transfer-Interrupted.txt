Dear FACILITY_USER,

unfortunately the transfer service on "HOST_ALIAS" (HOST_NAME)
has been stopped while one of your transfers was still running, probably
due the computer being shut down.

Your transfer will resume without any additional action required once the
service is started again, which happens automatically when the computer has
finished booting up again.


Don't hesitate to contact EMAIL_FROM if you have any additional question.

Have a nice day
The Facility Team
